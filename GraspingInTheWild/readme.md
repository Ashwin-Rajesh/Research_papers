## What i understood
### Abstract
- High degrees of freedom and ability to dynamically react to the environment is important for grasping using robotic manipulators.
- Most grasping algorithms use open-loop systems and top-down movement, due to lack of training data
- A low-cost device is developed to collect data on diverse day-to-day grasping tasks from human volunteers.
- Reinforcement learning is used, along with this data to train a 6-Degree of freedom closed loop grasping model.
